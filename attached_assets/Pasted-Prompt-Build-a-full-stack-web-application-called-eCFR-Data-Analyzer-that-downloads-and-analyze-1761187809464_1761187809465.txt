Prompt:

Build a full-stack web application called “eCFR Data Analyzer” that downloads and analyzes U.S. Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) data from the official API at https://www.ecfr.gov/developers/documentation/api/v1
.

Functional Goals:

Data Collection Layer:

Write a backend service (in Python Flask or Node.js/Express) that:

Fetches and downloads the current eCFR data from the government API.

Normalizes and stores the JSON response in a server-side database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

Includes fields such as agency, title, chapter, section, and text.

Caches the timestamp of the last fetch and supports periodic refreshing.


Data Access API:

Expose RESTful endpoints such as:

GET /api/agencies — returns all agencies found in the data.

GET /api/agency/:name — returns all sections belonging to an agency.

GET /api/analysis/wordcount — returns average and total word count per agency.

GET /api/analysis/changes — returns historical data or revisions if available (based on eCFR history endpoint).

GET /api/analysis/checksums — returns a hash/checksum of text for each agency to detect content changes.

GET /api/analysis/custom — implements a custom metric of your choice:

Example: “Regulatory Complexity Index (RCI)” — calculate the average sentence length and vocabulary diversity (unique words ÷ total words) for each agency’s text.

Frontend UI

Build a simple dashboard using React (or Vue) that:

Lets users trigger “Download/Refresh eCFR data.”

Displays interactive charts (using Chart.js or Recharts) showing:

Word count per agency.

Historical changes (trend lines).

Checksum comparison (for detecting updated agencies).

Custom metric (RCI) comparison bar chart.

Includes a table view to review raw analysis results.

Meaningful Analysis:
Ensure analysis provides practical insights:
Identify which agencies have the most extensive regulations.
Track which agencies’ texts change most frequently.
Compute and visualize complexity trends using the custom metric.

Review & Export:

Include a “Review Results” page where users can:
Browse computed analytics.
Export results as CSV or JSON.
View timestamp of last analysis and checksum summaries.


Modular code structure (backend routes, services, frontend components)

Notes

Only compute metrics that provide meaningful information to users.

Include the custom metric “Regulatory Complexity Index” (RCI).

Include proper error handling for failed API calls.

Add documentation in README.md describing:

API routes

Analysis methods
