# eCFR Data Analyzer - Project Documentation

## Overview
A full-stack web application that downloads and analyzes U.S. Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) data from the official government API.

## Current Status
âœ… **Application Fully Functional with Live eCFR Data**
- Successfully fetching and analyzing real U.S. federal regulations
- 5 regulations loaded with over 2 million words analyzed
- All charts and analytics displaying live data
- Professional Material Design data dashboard aesthetic
- Dark mode default

## Project Architecture

### Data Models (shared/schema.ts)
- `regulations` table: Stores eCFR data with agency, title, chapter, section, text content, word count, checksum
- `fetchMetadata` table: Tracks data fetch operations with timestamp, status, error messages
- TypeScript interfaces for AgencyAnalysis, WordCountAnalysis, ChecksumData

### Frontend (client/src/)
**Pages:**
- `dashboard.tsx`: Hero section with refresh button, 4 metric cards (Total Agencies, Total Regulations, Total Words, Avg Complexity), 4 interactive charts (Word Count by Agency, RCI, Distribution, Vocabulary Diversity)
- `analysis.tsx`: Tabbed interface (Overview, Word Count, Complexity, Checksums) with sortable data tables and CSV/JSON export
- `navigation.tsx`: Top nav bar with active route highlighting

**Components:**
- `metric-card.tsx`: Reusable metric display with icon, value, optional trend
- `chart-card.tsx`: Wrapper for charts with title, description, icon
- `data-table.tsx`: Sortable table with column headers, empty states
- `export-buttons.tsx`: CSV and JSON export controls
- `loading-skeleton.tsx`: Loading states for metrics, charts, tables

### Backend (server/)
**Files:**
- `db.ts`: PostgreSQL connection using Neon with Drizzle ORM
- `storage.ts`: DatabaseStorage implementation with IStorage interface
- `routes.ts`: Express API routes for all endpoints
- `ecfr-service.ts`: eCFR API integration, XML parsing, text analysis, RCI calculation, checksum generation

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/metadata` - Latest fetch metadata
- `GET /api/agencies` - List all agencies
- `GET /api/agency/:name` - Regulations for specific agency
- `GET /api/analysis/agencies` - Complete analysis with RCI
- `GET /api/analysis/wordcount` - Word count metrics
- `GET /api/analysis/checksums` - Data integrity checksums
- `POST /api/fetch` - Trigger eCFR data fetch

**eCFR Integration:**
- Base URL: `https://www.ecfr.gov/api/versioner/v1`
- Titles endpoint: `/titles` - Returns list of all CFR titles with metadata
- Full content endpoint: `/full/{date}/title-{number}.xml` - Returns complete regulatory text in XML format
- XML parsing: Extracts plain text from XML structure for analysis

### Analysis Methods
**Regulatory Complexity Index (RCI):**
- Formula: Average Sentence Length Ã— Vocabulary Diversity
- Measures regulatory text complexity
- Higher values indicate more complex language

**Text Analysis:**
- Word counting and sentence parsing
- Unique word identification for vocabulary diversity
- SHA-256 checksum generation for change detection

## Database Schema
Created via execute_sql_tool:
```sql
regulations (id, agency, title, chapter, section, text_content, word_count, checksum, created_at)
fetch_metadata (id, last_fetch_at, status, total_regulations, error_message)
```

## User Preferences
- App name: "eCFR Data Analyzer" (displayed in navigation and page titles)

## Recent Changes
- 2025-10-28: Added memory management and error handling improvements
  - Implemented XML size checking (75M character limit) to prevent crashes
  - Added automatic skipping of extremely large titles (Title 40)
  - Improved error handling to maintain accurate metadata even on fetch failures
  - Enhanced garbage collection with explicit memory cleanup
  - Successfully processed Title 26 (73M chars, 12M words) without issues
  - Total of 48 CFR titles analyzed (Title 40 excluded)
  
- 2025-10-27: Implemented complete selective refresh feature for CFR titles
  - Added checkbox UI to select specific titles for refresh
  - Implemented backend deletion of specific agencies using Drizzle's `inArray()`
  - Fixed metadata calculation to show correct total regulation count (not just current fetch)
  - Added comprehensive query invalidation (agencies, wordcount, checksums)
  - Real-time progress tracking with X/N format during selective refresh
  - "Loaded" badges appear for successfully refreshed titles
  - Data persists across all page navigation
  - Dashboard metrics remain accurate after selective refresh
  
- 2025-10-23: Complete implementation and deployment
  - All frontend components built with Material Design data dashboard aesthetic
  - All backend services and API endpoints implemented
  - PostgreSQL database schema created and operational
  - Export functionality (CSV/JSON) implemented
  - Loading states and error handling in place
  - Fixed React nested anchor tag warnings
  - Application running successfully on port 5000

## Next Steps for Users
1. âœ… Click "Refresh Data" button on Dashboard to fetch all CFR titles (Working!)
2. âœ… Use Titles page to selectively refresh specific CFR titles (Working!)
3. âœ… View real-time analytics in charts and metric cards (Working!)
4. âœ… Explore detailed analysis in the Analysis page (Working!)
5. âœ… Export data using CSV or JSON export buttons (Working!)
6. ðŸš€ Publish the application to make it publicly accessible

## Known Limitations

### Title 40 (Protection of Environment)
- **Size**: Title 40 exceeds 75 million characters in XML format
- **Status**: Automatically skipped to prevent memory crashes
- **Impact**: This title contains EPA environmental regulations and cannot be analyzed with current memory constraints
- **Workaround**: The app will gracefully skip Title 40 with a warning message and continue processing other titles
- **Total CFR Titles**: 48 out of 49 available (Title 40 excluded)

### Minor UI Issues
- Progress indicator may remain visible after selective refresh completes (workaround: refresh page)
