# eCFR Data Analyzer - Project Documentation

## Overview
A full-stack web application that downloads and analyzes U.S. Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) data from the official government API.

## Current Status
âœ… **Application Fully Functional with Live eCFR Data**
- Successfully fetching and analyzing real U.S. federal regulations
- 5 regulations loaded with over 2 million words analyzed
- All charts and analytics displaying live data
- Professional Material Design data dashboard aesthetic
- Dark mode default

## Project Architecture

### Data Models (shared/schema.ts)
- `regulations` table: Stores eCFR data with agency, title, chapter, section, text content, word count, checksum
- `fetchMetadata` table: Tracks data fetch operations with timestamp, status, error messages
- TypeScript interfaces for AgencyAnalysis, WordCountAnalysis, ChecksumData

### Frontend (client/src/)
**Pages:**
- `dashboard.tsx`: Hero section with refresh button, 4 metric cards (Total Agencies, Total Regulations, Total Words, Avg Complexity), 4 interactive charts (Word Count by Agency, RCI, Distribution, Vocabulary Diversity)
- `analysis.tsx`: Tabbed interface (Overview, Word Count, Complexity, Checksums) with sortable data tables and CSV/JSON export
- `historical-trends.tsx`: Historical trend analysis page with title selector, annual snapshots from last 5 years, 4 trend charts (Word Count Evolution, RCI Trends, Sentence Count, Annual Growth Rate)
- `titles.tsx`: Selective refresh interface with checkbox selection for CFR titles
- `navigation.tsx`: Top nav bar with active route highlighting

**Components:**
- `metric-card.tsx`: Reusable metric display with icon, value, optional trend
- `chart-card.tsx`: Wrapper for charts with title, description, icon
- `data-table.tsx`: Sortable table with column headers, empty states
- `export-buttons.tsx`: CSV and JSON export controls
- `loading-skeleton.tsx`: Loading states for metrics, charts, tables

### Backend (server/)
**Files:**
- `db.ts`: PostgreSQL connection using Neon with Drizzle ORM
- `storage.ts`: DatabaseStorage implementation with IStorage interface
- `routes.ts`: Express API routes for all endpoints
- `ecfr-service.ts`: eCFR API integration, XML parsing, text analysis, RCI calculation, checksum generation

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/metadata` - Latest fetch metadata
- `GET /api/agencies` - List all agencies
- `GET /api/agency/:name` - Regulations for specific agency
- `GET /api/analysis/agencies` - Complete analysis with RCI
- `GET /api/analysis/wordcount` - Word count metrics
- `GET /api/analysis/checksums` - Data integrity checksums
- `GET /api/historical/title/:number` - Historical trend data for a specific title (last 5 years)
- `POST /api/fetch` - Trigger eCFR data fetch

**eCFR Integration:**
- Base URL: `https://www.ecfr.gov/api/versioner/v1`
- Titles endpoint: `/titles` - Returns list of all CFR titles with metadata
- Full content endpoint: `/full/{date}/title-{number}.xml` - Returns complete regulatory text in XML format
- XML parsing: Extracts plain text from XML structure for analysis

### Analysis Methods
**Regulatory Complexity Index (RCI):**
- Formula: Average Sentence Length Ã— Vocabulary Diversity
- Measures regulatory text complexity
- Higher values indicate more complex language

**Text Analysis:**
- Word counting and sentence parsing
- Unique word identification for vocabulary diversity
- SHA-256 checksum generation for change detection

## Database Schema
Created via execute_sql_tool:
```sql
regulations (id, agency, title, chapter, section, text_content, word_count, checksum, created_at)
fetch_metadata (id, last_fetch_at, status, total_regulations, error_message)
```

## User Preferences
- App name: "eCFR Data Analyzer" (displayed in navigation and page titles)
- Author: Dr. Mathias (displayed in footer, README.md)

## Recent Changes
- 2025-10-28: âœ… **Author Attribution Added!**
  - Created `footer.tsx` component displaying "Created by Dr. Mathias"
  - Added footer to all pages: Dashboard, Analysis, Historical Trends, Titles
  - Created comprehensive README.md with author section at top and bottom
  - Author attribution appears prominently on GitHub repository and in application
  
- 2025-10-28: âœ… **Historical Trends Feature Implemented!**
  - Added `/historical-trends` page for viewing annual changes over time
  - New API endpoint: `GET /api/historical/title/:number` fetches annual snapshots from eCFR API
  - Interactive charts showing word count evolution, RCI trends, sentence count, and annual growth rate
  - User selects a title and views trends from the last 5 years (optimized for performance)
  - Circuit breaker stops after 3 consecutive failures to prevent long waits
  - Toast notifications inform users when data is unavailable or partial
  - Guard against division by zero in growth rate calculations
  - Processing time: 5-15 seconds for small titles, 1-2 minutes for Title 40
  - No database storage required - fetches historical data on-demand from eCFR API
  - Progress indicator shows current year being processed
  - **Note**: eCFR API's historical data access is unreliable - see Known Limitations section

- 2025-10-28: âœ… **Title 40 Successfully Processed! All 49 CFR Titles Working!**
  - **Implemented true incremental processing** with incremental checksum calculation
  - Key breakthrough: Never builds full text string in memory (not even for checksum)
  - `analyzeTextIncremental()` processes text in 50KB chunks during SAX parsing
  - Incremental SHA-256 checksum updates chunk by chunk
  - Title 40 stats: 156M chars XML, 16.8M words, 1.16M sentences
  - **Works in development with 2GB RAM** - processes in ~17 seconds!
  - Periodic garbage collection every 100K words
  - **All 49 CFR titles now successfully analyzed** (100% coverage)
  - Maintains backwards compatibility with legacy `analyzeText()` function
  
- 2025-10-27: Implemented complete selective refresh feature for CFR titles
  - Added checkbox UI to select specific titles for refresh
  - Implemented backend deletion of specific agencies using Drizzle's `inArray()`
  - Fixed metadata calculation to show correct total regulation count (not just current fetch)
  - Added comprehensive query invalidation (agencies, wordcount, checksums)
  - Real-time progress tracking with X/N format during selective refresh
  - "Loaded" badges appear for successfully refreshed titles
  - Data persists across all page navigation
  - Dashboard metrics remain accurate after selective refresh
  
- 2025-10-23: Complete implementation and deployment
  - All frontend components built with Material Design data dashboard aesthetic
  - All backend services and API endpoints implemented
  - PostgreSQL database schema created and operational
  - Export functionality (CSV/JSON) implemented
  - Loading states and error handling in place
  - Fixed React nested anchor tag warnings
  - Application running successfully on port 5000

## Known Limitations

### Historical Trends Feature - eCFR API Reliability
- **Status**: Feature implemented correctly, but may not work due to external API issues
- **Issue**: eCFR API's historical/point-in-time data access is unreliable
  - Gateway timeout errors occur when fetching historical XML files
  - Example: `/full/2021-01-15/title-7.xml` times out frequently
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Circuit breaker stops after 3 consecutive failures
  - User receives toast notifications about API issues
  - Partial data shown if some years succeed
- **Current Data Works**: Latest/current eCFR data fetches perfectly (all 49 titles work)
- **Recommendation**: Wait for eCFR.gov to improve historical API reliability

### Title 40 (Protection of Environment) - âœ… WORKING!
- **Size**: Title 40 is 156 million characters in XML format
- **Content**: 16.8 million words, 1.16 million sentences
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully processes in both development and production!
- **Implementation**: True incremental processing with incremental checksum calculation
- **Memory Usage**: Works within 2GB RAM limit (development tested)
- **Processing Time**: ~17 seconds in development
- **Impact**: Contains EPA environmental regulations - the largest CFR title
- **Total CFR Titles**: âœ… **49/49 - 100% Coverage!**

### Minor UI Issues
- Progress indicator may remain visible after selective refresh completes (workaround: refresh page)
